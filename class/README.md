- classes are written in pascel case
- toString method is available by default on top of class.
- classes are mutable by default.

   : Constructor is a function which runs when ever a class is initilised. We can do multiple things  like initilising values , calling some internal methods etc
   
### Types of Constructor
- no constructor
- default constrictor
- named constructor
```
```

- shortcut constructor
```
class Animal {
  int legs;
  String name;
  String color;
  bool isMamel;
  
  Animal(this.legs, this.name, this.color, this.isMamel); // Shortcut way to write constructor
}
```
- Constructor with named parameters
```
```

#### Private Variables

variables / properties which can not be accessed outside the class

```
```

- static const
- final property

- class inheritance
   vehicle car 
   super method

method overriding 
   : when we override a method which is present in parent class
@override

- getter setter


use it when no need of initilizing the class
- static function
- static variable
