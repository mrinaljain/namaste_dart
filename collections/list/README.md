# List

Just another name for Arrays like in oother programing languages.
- Lists are mutable i.e  we can change the value at any point.
- const lists are also posible
```
// example of const list
List<String> names = const [ "JAck", "Jill"];
```
- type inference workes while defining list
- staticaly typed is also possible
