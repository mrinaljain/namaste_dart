# DART

- Object oriented Programing lamguage
- Every dart program starts ith a main function
- 2 type of compilation happens
   - JIT
   - AOT
- Staticaly typed
   means datatype is defined along side the variable
```
final String name = "Mrinal";
String lastName = "Jain";
```
- Type inference also happens in Dart
   Means no need to define datatype while defining the variable, dart will automatically infer the type.
```
var name = "Mrinal";
``` 

- all the dart functionalites are available inside dart:core package
